               <p className="para_p  ">
                  To create a community-driven ecosystem of NFT collections under the umbrella of BarbarianInc, which is a special and unique NFT company catering to the larger crypto space as a whole. Our main goal is to establish ourselves as a brand upon which trust and value can come to be expected. Secondary to this, but still of massive importance to the team, we hope that this attitude and outlook will catch the attention of collectors not just within Hedera, but also with collectors from many other ecosystems outside of Hedera as well, acting as a catalyst to help grow the user base of Hedera itself.
                  <br/><br/>
                  <h1 className="h1_head_sml set_font"> The Problem as we see it </h1> 
                  Abuse of the term “Community Founders Passes”, a lack of transparency surrounding what is being built and/or worked on, the absence of a fully doxed team, and an overall lack of depth and utility surrounding certain collections are all issues that are not unique to the Hedera NFT space. In fact, it could be argued that these problems are far more common within other NFT ecosystems outside of Hedera, however, they are still very much present to a certain extent on our own home turf.
                  <br/><br/>
                  <h1 className="h1_head_sml set_font"> The Solution as we see it </h1> 
                  Provide outstanding real-world utility to all our collections. Anything released under the umbrella of BarbarianInc will have its own unique purpose and place within our ecosystem. Everything we build will be of the highest quality in terms of art, with extreme attention to detail being paid at every turn. Finally, dispelling the unfavorable views people have in regard to Community Founders Passes will be accomplished through tethering maximum functionality to our own CFPs, while simultaneously providing fully transparent and ongoing updates as new use cases arise for these.
                  <br/><br/>
                  <h1 className="h1_head_sml set_font"> Value Prop for the collections within the Barbarian Inc Ecosystem </h1> 
                  At BarbarianInc we aim to build value from the ground up, one collection at a time. By coupling timeless art and a plethora of announced holder benefits in conjunction with the release of our “Hbarbarians” Community Founders Passes, this will very much set the stage for what comes next, our Alternate Reality Game (ARG). We will then launch and roll out our 5 subsequent NFT collections associate with our ARG, which will offer a thrilling and rewarding experience for the community. Proceeding from this point, it starts to become clear that expectations surrounding quality and value in anything relating to BarbarianInc will be running at all-time highs. This will benefit holders most, as the perceived value of anything pertaining to our NFT ecosystem will also be running at all-time highs. Keeping up and maintaining this momentum will be our utmost priority. It is in this way that we will build and maintain value within our company, through actually delivering.
                  <br/><br/>
                  <h1 className="h1_head_sml set_font"> Funding </h1> 
                  Here at BarbarianInc, we are fostering an attitude of “If you build it, they will come”. Every mint we hold will have 20% (post launchpad fees, of course) placed into a company treasury to help fund all company-related needs and sub-contract work, and to build up the underlying valuation of BarbarianInc as a whole. We also plan on approaching VCs for funding once we have proven ourselves through the successful launch of the “Hbarbarians” Community Founders Passes and our ARG “The Lost Ones”. Are we hinging a lot on the hope that our future VC funding round is a success? Yes. It is best, to be honest about this and not try to play games. However, we genuinely believe that we can and will receive said funding as long as we do our jobs in delivering what we have promised with the CFPs and ARG.
